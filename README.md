### Cstick..SLDPRT
The candlestick solidworks assignment was about what you would assusme: a candlestick. I learned how to use sweeps in this assignment.

### MinecraftPressurePlate.SLDPRT
In this assignment I created a pressure plate (It's not a Minecraft pressure plate but I decided to name it that because Minecraft is one of the few places I have heard that term be used). Since it was a tutorial it was rather easy, but clicking through all the steps I already knew how to do was irritating.

### ShellBoi.SLDPRT
In this assignment I created half of some sort of box. I'm not sure what this assignment was supposed to be for but it was kind of fun. I think it's just because I really like small containers.

### ShellBoi2.SLDPRT
This is the lid to the other half of the box. It was rather easy to make but I had some trouble cutting the spot where the boxes would fit together.

### ShellBoiAssembly.SLDASM
This is an assembly of the other two parts. It was very easy and only took a few mates to finish.

### Mjolnir.SLDPRT
For this assignment I created a hammer(If you don't know why it's called Mjolnir then I recommend you go read up on some norse mythology). It was a culmination of my abilities that I learned while doing the other projects, and it also taught me how to use lofts.
